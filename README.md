# Network-Sweep-Scan
Hi there,

I am very delighted to contribute my own developed Network-Sweep-Scan script tool to Ethical Hackers, Security Researchers and Infosec communities out there as a gesture of gratitude for being used lot more free stuff from communities. No gesture is too small when done with gratitude. 

The script scans the network and provides faster results with a list of ip addresses of live hosts as it does not perform any port scanning. In short, it's only a host discovery script.


Usage: ./networksweep.sh <Your-Network/24>

It gives the result on the terminal as well as in 'livehosts.txt' file.
