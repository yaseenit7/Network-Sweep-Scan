# Network-Sweep-Scan
Hello there, 
This simple script was created by me and have not copied from anywhere so it feels great to contribute even a small bit of anything to Pen Testers community as a grateful return gesture for what we have acquired lots of free stuff...

Will be contributing more in future...Insha Allah

This simple script will give you a list of live hosts on a network.

Download the script and change the permission to executable mode.

Usage:   ./networksweep.sh <Your-Network/24>

You will get it's output on terminal as well as in a .txt file called 'livehosts.txt'
