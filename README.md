# Network-Sweep-Scan
Hello there, 

It feels great to contribute a tool or script to Ethical Hackers and Security Researchers Community as a gesture of gratitude for being used lot more free stuff from the community. No gesture is too small when done with gratitude. I am delighted to contribute my own developed Network Sweep Scan script which scans for the live hosts on a network. It provides a list of ip address of live hosts and faster results as it does not do any port scanning


Download the script from GitHub repository https://github.com/yaseenit7/Network-Sweep-Scan

Usage: ./networksweep.sh <Your-Network/24>

It gives you the output on the terminal as well as in 'livehosts.txt' file.
